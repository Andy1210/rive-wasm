# Rive Wasm runtime and JS runtime

This repo contains two web projects: [Rive's low level Wasm runtime](https://github.com/rive-app/rive-wasm/tree/master/wasm) and [Rive's JS runtime](https://github.com/rive-app/rive-wasm/tree/master/js), which is very new and currently in beta.

If you want to embed Rive animations in your web app or site, we recommend using the [JS runtime](https://github.com/rive-app/rive-wasm/tree/master/js). While it is in beta, it's designed to be simple to use and easy to update as we evolve it.

If you want to do some crazy, off the beaten track stuff that the JS runtime doesn't support, then the [low level runtime](https://github.com/rive-app/rive-wasm/tree/master/wasm) gives you the greatest flexibility and the cost of having to do a lot of the heavy lifting.
